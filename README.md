# Headwire Frontend Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to turn the image in **mockup.png** into a functioning web page!

Requirements:

- The nav should be fixed to the top of the window when scrolling, also known as a sticky nav

- The nav background should be transparent if the page has not been scrolled. The nav should look like `nav-mockup.png` if the page has been scrolled.

- The last component on the page should be a functioning accordion, meaning when an accordion item is activated all other accordion items should close.

- All of the images for the page are located in the `/assets` folder.

- The font used on the page is called Muli, which you can get from https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Muli

- **The final page should resemble the mockup as closely as possible**

You may use whatever web technologies you see fit, however please do not use anything out of the box for the accordion component - the logic for this component should be your own.
